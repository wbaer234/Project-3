# Project-3

Project Summary

The Corner Grocer program was developed to analyze daily transaction data and determine the frequency of purchased items. This information assists the store in reorganizing its produce section to better align with customer purchasing behaviors. The program reads from an input text file titled CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt, which contains a chronological list of items purchased throughout the day. Using this data, the program calculates how many times each item appears and provides users with a simple, text-based interface. The menu allows users to search for a specific item, view a complete list of all items with their corresponding purchase frequencies, or visualize the data in the form of a histogram that uses asterisks to represent quantity. Additionally, the program automatically generates a secondary file titled frequency.dat, which serves as a data backup to preserve frequency information.

Through this project, I aimed to design a program that not only fulfilled functional requirements but also demonstrated strong principles of code readability, structure, and maintainability. The solution embodies modular design, clear documentation, and appropriate use of C++ data structures, which together create a reliable and user-friendly analytical tool.


What I Did Well

One area where I believe I performed particularly well was in creating a well-organized and readable codebase. The use of a class structure that clearly separates public and private members allowed for better encapsulation and modularity. This approach made the code easier to understand, test, and maintain. I also implemented a map container to efficiently store item names as keys and their corresponding purchase frequencies as values. The use of this data structure simplified the process of retrieving and displaying information, while also improving performance when generating frequency lists and histograms.

In addition, I took care to write clear and consistent inline comments and function headers that explain the purpose of each section of code. I prioritized user experience by ensuring that the menu system was straightforward, error-tolerant, and responsive to invalid inputs. Overall, I am proud of how I integrated both efficiency and usability within a single cohesive program.


Areas for Enhancement

Although the project successfully meets its objectives, there are several aspects that could be improved in future iterations. One possible enhancement would be to increase the program’s efficiency in handling larger datasets. For example, buffered file input or multithreaded data processing could be implemented to optimize performance when analyzing thousands of records. From a security and robustness standpoint, further input validation could be added to manage unexpected user entries, such as special characters, empty inputs, or malformed data within the text file.

Another area for potential enhancement lies in the program’s presentation. Currently, the histogram display is functional but minimalist. Adding color, spacing adjustments, or formatting elements could improve visual clarity and make the output more intuitive for users. These improvements would not only enhance the user experience but also strengthen the program’s scalability, reliability, and professional quality.


Challenges and Problem-Solving

The most significant challenge I encountered during this project involved managing file input and output operations alongside the use of C++ maps. Initially, I struggled with properly reading the text file and storing unique items without introducing duplicate keys or formatting inconsistencies. To overcome these difficulties, I engaged in a systematic problem-solving process. I revisited relevant material in zyBooks Section 11.4 on Maps, consulted online references such as cppreference.com, and utilized the Visual Studio debugger to trace program flow and verify data accuracy at each stage.

Through this iterative process, I developed a deeper understanding of how file streams interact with data structures in C++. I also learned the importance of verifying assumptions about program state and data handling. This challenge ultimately strengthened my ability to troubleshoot complex logic errors and deepened my appreciation for the value of deliberate testing and debugging strategies.


Code Maintainability and Readability

Throughout development, I focused on ensuring that the program would remain maintainable, readable, and adaptable to future needs. Consistent naming conventions were applied to variables, functions, and classes to make the code self-explanatory. Inline comments and structured documentation were used to clarify logic and support long-term maintainability. Each function was designed to perform a single, clearly defined task, which simplifies debugging and future modification.
